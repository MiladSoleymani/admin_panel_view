The admin panel manages multiple AI applications, each providing different services to end users. Applications are independent services that share the same user base and authentication system.

## Application Types

### Current Applications
1. **Blog Generator**: AI-powered blog post creation
2. **Content Creator**: General content generation tool
3. **Image Generator**: AI image creation service
4. **Code Assistant**: Programming help and code generation
5. **Translation Service**: Multi-language translation
6. (More can be added as the platform grows)
